# VueStarter

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
# api server will run on localhost:3000
npm run server
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
# front-end and api runs on localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run server
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

This is a MakeItMobile Vue starter based on vue-loader. With this starter we have a project with a Bootstrap 4, a basic API wrapper, front-end router, Bus for connecting components that need to go up the chain, and a webpack backend proxie which allows us to run webpack and our backend api.
